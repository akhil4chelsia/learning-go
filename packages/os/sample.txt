The NATS cloud-native messaging ecosystem first came with a 
simple NATS server based on “At-most once” delivery model that forwards 
the published messages to consumers without any persistence for the 
published messages, with an industry leading performance. 
For some kind of applications, the basic NATS platform is adequate where  
you don’t need an event streaming platform and can gain the performance 
benefits as well. With “At-most once” delivery model, if any of the subscriber
systems, is down while forwarding the messages to subscriber systems by messaging 
server, then those messages will be missed in subscriber systems and thus 
there is no guarantee of delivery for the published messages.
